## 1. Introduction
SpendWise ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Android application collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## 2. Information We Collect

### A. SMS and Notification Data
We access your device's notifications solely for the purpose of:
*   Detecting financial transactions (debits/credits).
*   Extracting transaction details (Amount, Merchant, Date).
*   Categorizing your expenses.

**We DO NOT:**
*   Read your personal SMS messages (OTP, personal chats).
*   Read notifications from non-financial apps (WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.).
*   Upload your raw notification content to any cloud server.

**All processing of notification text happens locally on your device.**

### B. User Account Data (Optional)
If you choose to sign in with Google:
*   We collect your Email Address and Name for authentication.
*   This data is stored securely using Supabase (hosted on AWS).

### C. Financial Data
*   Your transaction history is stored locally on your device in an encrypted database.
*   If you enable "Cloud Backup" (future feature), encrypted backups may be stored on your Google Drive or our secure servers.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
*   **Expense Tracking:** To provide you with dashboards and insights.
*   **AI Categorization:** We use a local AI model (Gemma) to categorize transactions. No data leaves your device for this.
*   **Cloud AI (Optional):** If you enable Gemini Cloud features, anonymized transaction text (merchant name) may be sent to Google's Gemini API for advanced insights. This is optional and disabled by default.

## 4. Data Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal data.

## 5. Data Security
*   We use industry-standard encryption (SQLCipher) for your local database.
*   Network communication uses SSL/TLS.
